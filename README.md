This group project was hard to do given how much rested on my shoulders. Regardless, I found out I enjoyed the list library much more than I did implemented a struct based linked list in the last individual assignment. Nevertheless it was still quite the challenge. I enjoyed using the other class as it made things somewhat easier, and was simple.

This project uses the list library and linked lists to make a database of books and their respective information.
